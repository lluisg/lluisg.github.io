            "DESCRIPTION": "Youtube is one of the most important platforms in the world, and there exists a lot of interest in the content creators side to predict the number of views their future video will get. As such I created an Deep Learning architecture using an LSTM model to try to predict the future views obtained by a video on a channel taking into account the information available from their previous uploaded videos. During this I found that not much suitable data could be found on the internet, so a recompiled sequential information of the videos uploaded by different channels on Youtube.<br/><br/>To obtain the data I wanted from Youtube, I used the data from 3 different sources: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=GBvideos.csv\">Trending YouTube Video Statistics by Mitchell J</a>, <a href=\"https://data.world/sevenup13/youtube-video-and-channel-metadata\">Youtube Video and Channel Metadata by Vishwanath Seshagiri </a>and the <a href=\"https://research.google.com/youtube8m/index.html\">YouTube-8M Dataset</a>.<br/><br/>I started collecting data around November 2020, although there have been some hiatus. Since then, I have compiled more than 171.000 unique channels from the original 3 sources. From those channels, I collected information of more than 388.000 unique videos from more than 19.800 channels. And with those videos information I built a model that obtained predictions with 21.38% accuracy."

To do so I implemented a Colab notebook with everything, using fewer sentences despite knowing that it will obtain worse results to make it work more quickly and assure it works. Then I adapted it into a python file which ran with more sentences and tries to obtain better results.<br/>The Transformer implementation was based on the one from Samuel Lynn-Evans in <a href=\"https://blog.floydhub.com/the-transformer-in-pytorch/\">his blog</a>.<br/><br/>The results obtained on the test set using Cross Entropy Loss and the Newscarl dataset were of 1.61 and 1.92 for the simplified version and the more complex version, respectively.

This chatbot, from a set of ingredients (sent to it in form of text or images), recommends what recipes can be done with them.<br/>At the beginning we got an initial version of the chatbot from the previous project. This version had implemented some chatbot functionality and made calls to two different REST API's. Spoonacular, to get recipes from a set of ingredients and Amazon Rekognition, to label the images sent by the users.<br/>The biggest differentiations from the previous version are:<br/>1. Be independent from any external REST API. That meant, we had to implement our own neural network to recognize ingredients and also, in order to be independent from Spoonacular, we had to model a Recipe, get the data, save it as SQL and implement the full API for this database in order to be able to use it.<br/>2. Create a user profile where we can have information about individuals. With this we accomplished to know better our customer and based on his diet, recommend only recipes that fit him. We also added a ranking system by which the recipes could get an overall ranking and the users could save recipes as 'favorite'.<br/>To recommend a recipe by its ingredients, we implemented an algorithm that classified the recipes by its ingredients, measuring how well those ingredients 'fitted' with the searched ones. We also implemented a histogram based algorithm to recommend a recipe knowing which were the last recipes the user had searched and which rank he had rated them with.<br/>The chatbot could be used from december 2018 to february 2019 at @culinary_chatbot on Telegram"
